    <div id="learning">
        Human learning starts at birth (it might even start before in terms of an embryo's need for both interaction with, 
        and freedom within its environment within the womb.) and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions
         between people and their environment. The nature and processes involved in learning are studied in many established fields
          (including educational psychology, neuropsychology, experimental psychology, cognitive sciences, and pedagogy), as well as
           emerging fields of knowledge (e.g. with a shared interest in the topic of learning from safety events such as incidents/
           accidents, or in collaborative learning health systems). Research in such fields has led to the identification of 
           various sorts of learning. For example, learning may occur as a result of habituation, or classical conditioning, operant 
           conditioning or as a result of more complex activities such as play, seen only in relatively intelligent animals.
            Learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness.
